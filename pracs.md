Here is the complete code for generating a Naïve Bayes classifier and evaluating it using the Playtennis and Breast Cancer datasets in Python for Google Colab:

### Python Code for Google Colab

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load Playtennis Dataset
url_playtennis = "URL_TO_PLAYTENNIS_DATASET"
playtennis_data = pd.read_csv(url_playtennis)

# Process Playtennis Dataset
# Assuming the dataset has columns: 'Outlook', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind', 'PlayTennis'
# Encode categorical variables if necessary
playtennis_data = pd.get_dummies(playtennis_data, columns=['Outlook', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind'])
X_playtennis = playtennis_data.drop('PlayTennis', axis=1)
y_playtennis = playtennis_data['PlayTennis']

# Split the Playtennis dataset
X_train_play, X_test_play, y_train_play, y_test_play = train_test_split(X_playtennis, y_playtennis, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and train Naïve Bayes model for Playtennis dataset
model_play = GaussianNB()
model_play.fit(X_train_play, y_train_play)
y_pred_play = model_play.predict(X_test_play)

# Evaluate model for Playtennis dataset
conf_matrix_play = confusion_matrix(y_test_play, y_pred_play)
accuracy_play = accuracy_score(y_test_play, y_pred_play)
class_report_play = classification_report(y_test_play, y_pred_play)

print("Confusion Matrix for Playtennis Dataset:")
print(conf_matrix_play)
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {accuracy_play:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(class_report_play)

# Load Breast Cancer Dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
breast_cancer_data = load_breast_cancer(as_frame=True)
X_cancer = breast_cancer_data.data
y_cancer = breast_cancer_data.target

# Split the Breast Cancer dataset
X_train_cancer, X_test_cancer, y_train_cancer, y_test_cancer = train_test_split(X_cancer, y_cancer, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and train Naïve Bayes model for Breast Cancer dataset
model_cancer = GaussianNB()
model_cancer.fit(X_train_cancer, y_train_cancer)
y_pred_cancer = model_cancer.predict(X_test_cancer)

# Evaluate model for Breast Cancer dataset
conf_matrix_cancer = confusion_matrix(y_test_cancer, y_pred_cancer)
accuracy_cancer = accuracy_score(y_test_cancer, y_pred_cancer)
class_report_cancer = classification_report(y_test_cancer, y_pred_cancer)

print("Confusion Matrix for Breast Cancer Dataset:")
print(conf_matrix_cancer)
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {accuracy_cancer:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(class_report_cancer)
```

### Steps in Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Copy and paste the above code into a cell in the notebook.
4. Replace `"URL_TO_PLAYTENNIS_DATASET"` with the actual URL of the Playtennis dataset.
5. Run the cell to load the datasets, create the Naïve Bayes classifiers, and evaluate them.

This code will generate the Naïve Bayes classifiers for both datasets, report the overall and class-wise accuracy using confusion matrices, and print the classification reports.
