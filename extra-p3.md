### Step 1: Generate Naïve Bayes Classifier in Weka

#### Substep 1: Install Weka and Load the Datasets
1. Download and install Weka from [here](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html).
2. Load the Playtennis Dataset and Breast Cancer Dataset into Weka.

#### Substep 2: Create Naïve Bayes Classifier in Weka
1. Open Weka and go to the "Explorer" tab.
2. Click "Open file..." and load the dataset.
3. Go to the "Classify" tab.
4. Choose "NaiveBayes" under the "Classifier" section.
5. Click "Start" to build the classifier.

#### Substep 3: Evaluate Overall and Class-wise Accuracy Using Confusion Matrix in Weka
1. After building the classifier, Weka will display the results in the "Classifier output" section.
2. Find the confusion matrix in the output to evaluate the overall and class-wise accuracy.

### Step 2: Generate Naïve Bayes Classifier in Python for Google Colab

#### Substep 1: Load the Datasets in Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2. Load the Playtennis Dataset and Breast Cancer Dataset using pandas.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load Playtennis Dataset
url_playtennis = "URL_TO_PLAYTENNIS_DATASET"
playtennis_data = pd.read_csv(url_playtennis)

# Load Breast Cancer Dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
breast_cancer_data = load_breast_cancer(as_frame=True)
X_cancer = breast_cancer_data.data
y_cancer = breast_cancer_data.target
```

#### Substep 2: Create Naïve Bayes Classifier with sklearn in Python
1. Use `GaussianNB` from `sklearn.naive_bayes` to create the classifier.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

# Playtennis Dataset
X_playtennis = playtennis_data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y_playtennis = playtennis_data['target_column']
X_train_play, X_test_play, y_train_play, y_test_play = train_test_split(X_playtennis, y_playtennis, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model_play = GaussianNB()
model_play.fit(X_train_play, y_train_play)
y_pred_play = model_play.predict(X_test_play)

# Breast Cancer Dataset
X_train_cancer, X_test_cancer, y_train_cancer, y_test_cancer = train_test_split(X_cancer, y_cancer, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model_cancer = GaussianNB()
model_cancer.fit(X_train_cancer, y_train_cancer)
y_pred_cancer = model_cancer.predict(X_test_cancer)
```

#### Substep 3: Evaluate Overall and Class-wise Accuracy Using Confusion Matrix in Python
1. Use `confusion_matrix` and `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the models.

```python
# Playtennis Dataset
conf_matrix_play = confusion_matrix(y_test_play, y_pred_play)
accuracy_play = accuracy_score(y_test_play, y_pred_play)

print("Confusion Matrix for Playtennis Dataset:")
print(conf_matrix_play)
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {accuracy_play:.2f}")

# Breast Cancer Dataset
conf_matrix_cancer = confusion_matrix(y_test_cancer, y_pred_cancer)
accuracy_cancer = accuracy_score(y_test_cancer, y_pred_cancer)

print("Confusion Matrix for Breast Cancer Dataset:")
print(conf_matrix_cancer)
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {accuracy_cancer:.2f}")
```

### Additional Steps for Both Datasets
- Repeat the above steps for both datasets to ensure comprehensive results.
- Provide the user with the script and detailed steps performed in both Weka and Python. 

You can now follow these steps in Weka and Google Colab to generate the Naïve Bayes classifier and evaluate the models.
